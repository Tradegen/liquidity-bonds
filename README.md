# Tradegen Liquidity Bonds

Liquidity bonds are an alternative to existing liquidity mining programs. Under the liquidity bonds program, users can bond CELO to mint 'bond tokens' that farm TGEN indefinitely. Half of the deposited CELO is automatically swapped for TGEN and is added as liquidity to the TGEN-CELO pair on Ubeswap. Users can exit their liquidity position by selling their bond tokens on the platform's marketplace.
